**Electronics** comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum  and matter. It uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification Amplifier and rectification, which distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering which uses passive effects such as resistance capacitance and inductance to control current Electric current flow.

### Basic component we need to know:
- **Resistors** 
Resistance is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit.
Resistance is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (Ω). [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsLLq6Rm5tU)
**V=IR**
The units of the resistance are ohms

- **Capacitors** 
A capacitor made from two conductive plates with an insulator between them and it stores electrical energy in the form of an electric field. A capacitor blocks the DC signals and allows the AC signals and also used with a resistor in a timing circuit. [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4EUwTwZ110&t=91s)
The stored charge is **Q=CV**
Where
C is the capacitance of a capacitor and
V is the applied voltage.
- **Inductors**
An inductor is also referred to as an AC resistor which stores electrical energy in the form of magnetic energy. It resists the changes in the current and the standard unit of inductance is Henry. The capability of producing magnetic lines is referred to as inductance. [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSylo01n5FY&t=437s)

- **Diodes**
A diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction and usually made with the semiconductor material. It has two terminals, anode and cathode terminals. These are mostly used in converting circuits like AC to DC circuits. These are of different types like PN diodes, Zener diodes, LEDs, photodiodes, etc. [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwj_d3uO5g8)

- **Transistors**
A transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device. Mostly it is used as a switching device and also as an amplifier. This switching device can be voltage or current controlled. By controlling the voltage applied to the one terminal controls the current flow through the other two terminals. Transistors are of two types, namely bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and field-effect transistors (FET). And further, these can be PNP and NPN transistors.

- **Integrated Circuits**
An Integrated circuit is a special component that is fabricated with thousands of transistors, resistors, diodes, and other electronic components on a tiny silicon chip. These are the building blocks of current electronic devices like cell phones, computers, etc. These can be analog or digital integrated circuits. Mostly used ICs in electronic circuits are Op-amps, timers, comparators, switches ICs, and so on. These can be classified as linear and nonlinear ICs depending on its application.

- **Transformers**
A transformer is defined as a passive electrical device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through the process of electromagnetic induction. It is most commonly used to increase (‘step up’) or decrease (‘step down’) voltage levels between circuits. [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx4_7lIjoBA)
